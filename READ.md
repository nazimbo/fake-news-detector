# Fake News Detector

This project is a fake news detector that uses a machine learning model to classify news articles as fake or real. The model is trained on a dataset of news articles that are labeled as fake or real.

## Dataset

The dataset used to train the model is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/therealsampat/fake-news-detection/input). The dataset contains two CSV files, one with fake news articles and one with real news articles.
